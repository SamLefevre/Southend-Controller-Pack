**Changes now included in UK Controller Pack, no need for addon pack.**

Southend Controller Pack 2023/11 - By Sam Lefevre

Installation:

1. Drag the UK folder into Documents/Euroscope
2. Go to the Thames folder and there will be a Southend Custom Pack.prf file
3. Open in euroscope and you'll be able to use the controller pack!

Information:

You need the UK Controller pack from VATSIM UK so this controller pack intergrates with it, so it uses the lists.txt file so you don't need to reconfigure much.
ASRs can be found in Data/ASR/Thames, as can the settings.

The Radar:

CAS:

In the CTR the controlled airspace is shows as: -3.5 for example, this is sfc-3500ft, and then above 3500ft is the LTMA
The CTA shows 1.5-3.5 for CTA 1, this is 1500ft-3500ft
